# DataPipeline-Toolkit

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for processing and analyzing datasets. It focuses on three key stages:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's structure, identifying key features, and spotting initial issues such as missing values or irrelevant columns.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the dataset by addressing common quality issues like missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights from the cleaned data through various analytical techniques.

## Features
- Efficient handling of missing values and outliers.
- Automated detection and removal of duplicates.
- Clear structure for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Tools for resolving inconsistencies and preparing high-quality datasets.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
